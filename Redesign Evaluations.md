# ✅ Redesign Evaluations

General pedagogical redesign strategies that future-proof evaluations against AI misuse.

| **Strategy** | **Description** | **Key Techniques** |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Diversify Assessment Formats** | Create assessments that go beyond what AI can easily replicate by integrating diverse, dynamic, and authentic tasks. | • **Use of subscription-only sources and current events**: Require students to work with resources not in AI training data (e.g., paywalled journals, very recent events). <br> • **Multimodal formats**: Combine text, images, videos, animations, and infographics to challenge AI and allow students to demonstrate learning in varied ways. <br> • **Real-time and longitudinal assessments**: Use live exams, performances, or clinical demonstrations, as well as portfolio-based tasks showing growth over time. <br> • **Dialogic evaluations**: Include viva voce/oral exams, iterative project reviews, or continuous dialogue with the evaluator. <br> • **Programmatic assessment**: Employ interconnected methods across time, focusing on broader competencies rather than isolated products. |
| **Evaluate the Process, Not Just the Product** | Focus on how students learn and build knowledge, making evaluations harder for AI to fake. | • **Document and reflect on thinking processes**: Require students to show iterations, decision-making, and reasoning steps. <br> • **Self-evaluation and reflection on AI use**: Encourage honest reporting of how AI was used, fostering awareness of integrity. <br> • **Work visibility**: Collect drafts, sketches, and reflective logs to make learning progress transparent. <br> • **Collaborative work**: Use group projects where individual contributions depend on one another, emphasizing social-constructivist learning. |
| **Emphasize Higher-Order Cognitive Skills & Contextual Knowledge** | Design assessments that leverage AI’s limitations in contextual reasoning and creative application. | • **Critical thinking and synthesis tasks**: Ask students to analyze, evaluate, and create (Bloom’s higher-order skills), instead of relying on recall or summary. <br> • **Connections across concepts**: Require integration of knowledge across disciplines or contexts. <br> • **Contextualized/personalized knowledge**: Ask students to apply theories to specific cases, personal experiences, or real-world problems, ensuring authentic engagement. |
