# 🤖 AI for Education

This repo explores the opportunities and challenges of integrating AI into Education.

Education is way more than content delivery and classrooms. It's a space to foster critical thinking, promote shared dialogue, encourage creativity, and shape individual and collective thought. Education plays a vital role in sustaining societal sovereignty, nurturing the capacity of communities to think independently and govern their own futures.

This project seeks to ensure that education remains a transformative force in society. One that empowers learners, protects integrity, and shapes democratic futures.
