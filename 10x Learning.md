# 🚀 10x Learning

This is a collection of resources to accelerate learning, allowing you to improve skill acquisition, play with concepts, and observe real-time consequences.

### Visualization

- **[LLM Visualization](https://bbycroft.net/llm)**
  *A stunning 3D interactive walk-through of a Large Language Model architecture, showing exactly how data flows through the layers.*

- **[GAN Lab](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/)**
  *An interactive, browser-based experiment to understand Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). You can train a model in real-time and visualize the "battle" between the generator and the discriminator.*

- **[TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.79015&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false)**
  *An interactive neural network simulation. You can tweak learning rates, activation functions, and hidden layers to see how a network "learns" to classify data in real-time.*

- **[NN-SVG](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/AlexNet.html)**
  *A tool to interactively design and export SVG illustrations of Neural Network architectures. It helps visualize the scale and connectivity of classic models like AlexNet and LeNet.*

- **[Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)**
  *A visual introduction to probability and statistics from Brown University. It turns dry formulas into interactive, visual experiments.*

- **[Visual Information](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/)**
  *Christopher Olah’s legendary visual essays on machine learning and information theory. He explains complex mathematical concepts through intuitive geometry and visualization.*

### Learn Faster

- **[Andrej Karpathy's Learning Philosophy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990577951671509438)**
  *A practical workflow for using LLMs to deepen reading comprehension. Karpathy outlines his "three-pass" technique—manual reading, AI summarization, and interactive Q&A—to transform passive consumption into active, high-retention learning.*

- **[Longcut.ai](https://www.longcut.ai/)**
  *A search engine and discovery platform specifically tuned for high-quality AI learning resources. It cuts through the noise of generic content, helping you find the best tutorials, papers, and guides to accelerate your specific learning path.*

- **[The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Rapid-Skill-Acquisition-Information-ebook/dp/B07NS6QNSR)**
  *A deep dive into the neurology and psychology of learning. This resource deconstructs the process of mastery into actionable steps—such as deliberate practice and gamification—providing a blueprint to absorb complex information and skills in record time.*
