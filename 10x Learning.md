# 🚀 10x Learning

This is a collection of tools to bridge the gap between theory and practice, allowing you to play with concepts and observe real-time consequences.

### Visualization

- **[LLM Visualization](https://bbycroft.net/llm)**
  *A stunning 3D interactive walk-through of a Large Language Model architecture, showing exactly how data flows through the layers.*

- **[GAN Lab](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/)**
  *An interactive, browser-based experiment to understand Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). You can train a model in real-time and visualize the "battle" between the generator and the discriminator.*

- **[TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.79015&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false)**
  *An interactive neural network simulation. You can tweak learning rates, activation functions, and hidden layers to see how a network "learns" to classify data in real-time.*

- **[NN-SVG](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/AlexNet.html)**
  *A tool to interactively design and export SVG illustrations of Neural Network architectures. It helps visualize the scale and connectivity of classic models like AlexNet and LeNet.*

- **[Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)**
  *A visual introduction to probability and statistics from Brown University. It turns dry formulas into interactive, visual experiments.*

- **[Visual Information](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/)**
  *Christopher Olah’s legendary visual essays on machine learning and information theory. He explains complex mathematical concepts through intuitive geometry and visualization.*
